# Star/Galaxy Classification in a Galaxy Cluster Field Using Machine Learning
Fall 2024 - DATA 1030 - Final Project

_Author: Zacharias Escalante_

This project entails analyzing a catalog of source information contained in the field of the Abell 3266 galaxy cluster field, created using data from the LoVoCCS survey and other external surveys. Exploratory data analysis is first carried out, followed by the engineering of new features, as well as data splitting and preprocessing in preparation for passing into a machine learing pipeline.
